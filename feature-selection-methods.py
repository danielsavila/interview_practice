#how do you employ feature selection? (3 options)
'''
1. manually filtering features from original dataset (using correlation matrix to remove duplicate/non-predictive features)
2. wrapper methods (iteratively adding an additional feature, running a model, then seeing how adding a feature improves performance)
3. regularization (within the model adding terms that automatically enabale feature selection)
